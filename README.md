# peter-shor-prime-factorisation
this algorithme factorizes a given number using peter shor's algoritm

This code factors a number using peter shor's algorithm.

The get_factor function randomly chooses a number between the value of n passed as a parameter to be able to search for the corresponding period which will allow us to find the values ​​of p and q as defined by the peter shor algorithm. The function returns a tuplets of the tuplets which contain the period, the values ​​of p and k but also the a which made it possible to find the period
